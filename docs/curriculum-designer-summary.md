# Senior Curriculum Designer — Highlights

Profile
- Curriculum designer creating immersive, interactive learning enhanced by emerging tech (VR/AR, simulation, data-informed iteration).
- Proven leader managing multi-disciplinary initiatives with educators, developers, creative producers, and researchers.
- Expert in project-based learning, assessment alignment, and career-connected STEM curricula that scale.
- Strong media and narrative craft from on-camera and live production work, applied to emotionally engaging learning.

Core strengths aligned to the role
- Curriculum design: backward design (goals → evidence → learning), UDL, PBL, authentic assessment
- Emerging tech integration: VR/AR-aligned lesson design, simulation-based practice, media-rich storytelling
- Multi-project leadership: prioritize, plan, and deliver multiple curricula across disciplines
- Collaboration: partner with SMEs, writers, developers; translate requirements into buildable learning
- Quality and iteration: pilot, collect data, iterate; maintain design standards and templates
- Instructor enablement: tutorials, rubrics, templates, checklists; consistent delivery
- Platforms/tools: LMS, authoring tools, prototyping, basic analytics, version control

Experience highlights mapped to essential duties
- Define learning goals and progressions: map SME inputs and standards to measurable outcomes and rubrics
- Translate goals to materials/assessments: lesson guides, labs/builds, performance tasks, and formative checks
- Use technology to enhance/scale: integrate VR/AR concepts, simulations, and narrative media for engagement
- Manage multiple curricula: run parallel programs with clear scope, dependencies, and milestones
- Collaborate cross-functionally: align narrative, mechanics, and outcomes with creative and technical teams
- Evaluate and iterate: pilot, gather feedback, improve scaffolding, pacing, and assets
- Build instructor resources: tutorials, build guides, safety standards, templates, and rubrics
- Specify innovative tools: recommend adaptive/simulation tools that meet curriculum goals
