Hiring Committee — Dreamscape Learn (EdPlus at ASU)
Creativity Commons — Tempe Campus

Dear Hiring Committee,

I’m excited to apply for the Senior Curriculum Designer role with Dreamscape Learn. My work blends evidence‑based curriculum design with immersive technologies and cinematic storytelling — the exact intersection at the heart of DSL’s mission. I build scalable, engaging learning experiences by aligning clear outcomes to interactive labs, authentic assessments, and instructor‑ready resources.

Evidence‑based design
I anchor every unit with backward design: clear, measurable outcomes → aligned evidence → learning experiences. I use UDL and PBL to make complex tasks accessible and meaningful. Each build includes authentic assessments, formative checks, and rubrics; cycles are piloted, feedback‑driven, and iterated to improve clarity and impact. [Add a one‑sentence example tied to your portfolio.]

Integrating SME input and source material
I synthesize SME interviews, research, and technical documentation into learner‑friendly assets: lesson guides, lab sheets, and performance tasks. I collaborate with writers, VR developers, and instructors to translate narrative and mechanics into teachable, assessable steps, maintaining templates and standards for consistency. [Add a one‑sentence example tied to VR/AR or simulation.]

Selected, relevant work
- Immersive + narrative learning: Phoenix Neutrino (live cinematic storytelling) · HGTV (on‑camera design/build)
- Experiential STEM: Zephyr (stratospheric mission) · Space Night (community‑scale interactive science)
- Engineering programs: Robotics (iterative builds, competitions) · CNC Lab (safety, production workflows)

Why DSL
I’m drawn to DSL’s vision: emotionally engaging, scientifically rigorous learning that scales. I bring strong collaboration habits across disciplines, a builder’s mindset, and a track record of shipping programs that align outcomes with memorable experiences. I’m eager to contribute to VR/2D labs and full‑course experiences that improve learner success.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
