    description: |
      I am a STEM educator and curriculum designer with more than 20 years of experience teaching engineering, robotics, and cybersecurity in Arizona public schools. Currently, I design immersive learning experiences for ASU Dreamscape Learn and serve on the Advisory Board for Higher Orbits, a national nonprofit using spaceflight to inspire STEM education.

      My background bridges technical education, media, and experiential design—from teaching Project Lead The Way engineering pathways and directing programs like Project Zephyr and the Phoenix Neutrino Project, to hosting three seasons of HGTV’s "Over Your Head." I am now expanding my research in AR and VR curriculum design through doctoral coursework in the Media Arts and Sciences (GAME) program at Arizona State University.
