    description: |
      I am a STEM educator and curriculum designer with more than twenty-four years of experience teaching engineering, robotics, and cybersecurity in Arizona public schools. My work now focuses on creating immersive and interactive learning experiences that merge science, storytelling, and technology.

      At Arizona State University, I design curriculum for Dreamscape Learn, developing experiential lessons that connect students to scientific discovery through narrative and virtual reality.

      My projects bridge technical education, media, and creative design—from Project Zephyr and the Phoenix Neutrino Project to three seasons on HGTV’s Over Your Head. I am currently completing graduate coursework in ASU’s School of Games, Arts, Media, and Engineering and will apply this winter for PhD candidacy. My research explores how AR/VR technologies can make learning more accessible, engaging, and inclusive for all students.

      Whether developing interactive labs, visualizing data, or building story-driven simulations, my goal is to design learning experiences that empower students to explore, question, and create.
