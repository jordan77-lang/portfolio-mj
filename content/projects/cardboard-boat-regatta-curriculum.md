</div>

This curriculum powers a district-wide engineering design challenge where students build and race life-sized boats made entirely of cardboard and adhesive materials. Teams apply physics and engineering principles to design buoyant, stable watercraft capable of carrying two paddlers across a pool course.

### Curriculum Components
- Engineering design process with iterative prototyping and testing
- Buoyancy, displacement, and structural design principles
- Materials selection, constraint-based design, and bill of materials
- Team roles, collaboration, and project management
- Competition rules, safety protocols, inspection checklists, and heat logistics

### Learning Impact
Students experience the complete design cycle—from concept to prototype to race day—building teamwork, problem solving, and applied STEM understanding in a high-energy community event.
