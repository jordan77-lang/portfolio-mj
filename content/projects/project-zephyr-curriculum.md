## Project Zephyr Curriculum

Project Zephyr is a student-led high-altitude weather balloon mission that brings aerospace engineering to life. This curriculum guides students through designing and building a payload, integrating sensors and cameras, planning a launch with FAA coordination, live tracking, field recovery, and post-flight analysis.

### Curriculum Components
- Atmospheric science and flight path prediction
- Sensor selection and payload design (temperature, pressure, humidity, IMU)
- APRS/GPS telemetry systems and live chase operations
- Power budgeting, thermal protection, and environmental shielding
- Launch logistics, FAA coordination, and recovery procedures
- Data collection, analysis, and student presentations

### Learning Outcomes
Students apply systems engineering, electronics integration, risk management, mapping, recovery logistics, and technical communication—skills directly transferable to aerospace, robotics, and data science.
