## Overview

The Sugar House Rocket project introduced students to amateur rocketry by designing and launching payloads aboard sugar-propellant rockets. This hands-on program emphasized propulsion science, payload design, and safe launch operations.

## Challenge

Students designed payloads to fit within mass and volume constraints, ensuring they could survive the acceleration, vibration, and recovery phases of a sugar rocket flight.

## Engineering Focus

- Propulsion fundamentals and rocket motor design
- Payload miniaturization and sensor integration
- Flight dynamics, recovery systems (parachutes), and data retrieval
- Safety protocols for mixing, handling, and launching experimental rockets

## Learning Outcomes

Students gained practical experience with rocketry principles, iterative testing, and real-world engineering trade-offsâ€”all while building and launching their own rockets.

## Impact

This project sparked enthusiasm for aerospace engineering and provided a tangible connection between classroom physics and hands-on experimentation.
