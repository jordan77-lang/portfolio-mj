## Educational Image Accessibility Tool

An educator-focused tool to create accessibility content for images: concise alt text, scientifically sound figure descriptions, long descriptions, and full-text transcriptions. Built around WCAG guidelines and institutional standards for education.

### Live application

### What it does
- Alt text (auto-validated to stay concise)

- Transcriptions (captures all visible text in reading order)

### Quick start
1) Open the site and drop an image
2) (Optional) Add context for better accuracy
3) Generate and copy the results

### Built for educators
- Prioritizes clarity over captions that “describe everything”
- Uses education-oriented standards and terminology
- Helps teams ship accessible curriculum at pace
