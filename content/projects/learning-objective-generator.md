## Overview

This web-based tool uses artificial intelligence to reverse‑engineer learning objectives from existing course materials such as outlines, assignments, and lesson text. By leveraging an OpenAI model and instructional design frameworks, it automatically generates measurable, standards‑aligned learning outcomes that support curriculum development and accreditation alignment.

Built with modern web technologies and integrated through an API, the tool analyzes uploaded or pasted content to identify intended learning outcomes and align them with cognitive levels, performance expectations, and disciplinary standards.

## Frameworks Applied

- Bloom’s Taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001) — for cognitive rigor and measurable verbs
- ABCD Model — for clarity in audience, behavior, condition, and degree
- SMART Criteria — for specificity and quality of objectives
- Constructive Alignment (Biggs & Tang, 2011) — ensuring learning goals align with instruction and assessment
- NGSS and CCSS Standards — for science and literacy integration
