## Overview

Over multiple academic years, I guided students through the complete lifecycle of aerospace payload design, construction, testing, and launch in partnership with leading aerospace organizations. These projects provided authentic engineering experiences where students collaborated with industry professionals to design experiments that would fly aboard actual rockets and high-altitude platforms.

Each partnership required students to work within real-world constraints—mass budgets, power requirements, telemetry specifications, and mission timelines—while developing testable hypotheses and collecting meaningful scientific data.

## Blue Origin Payload Mission

### Challenge
Design and build a student experiment payload to fly aboard a Blue Origin suborbital rocket. Students had to work within strict mass, size, and safety specifications while developing a mission that could collect meaningful data during the brief weightless phase of flight.

### Approach
Students formed mission teams, each responsible for different aspects of the payload: **Science Team** (developed testable hypotheses for microgravity experiments); **Engineering Team** (designed mechanical structures and sensor integration); **Data Team** (programmed data collection systems and telemetry); **Safety/Compliance Team** (ensured adherence to Blue Origin's payload requirements).

### Key Learning Outcomes
Systems engineering and integration processes; working with industry technical specifications; risk assessment and safety compliance; data analysis from real spaceflight hardware; professional communication with aerospace partners.

### Impact
Students experienced the complete arc of a space mission—from proposal to launch to data analysis. The partnership demonstrated that high school teams could contribute meaningful work to actual spaceflight missions when given proper mentorship and industry access.

## Sugar House Rocket Payload

### Challenge
Partner with Sugar House Rockets to design payloads for sugar-propellant amateur rocketry launches. Students needed to create compact, robust experiments that could survive the high-G forces of launch and collect data during ascent and recovery.

### Approach
This project emphasized hands-on fabrication and iterative testing: **Payload Design** (students created 3D CAD models and prototypes); **Sensor Selection** (chose appropriate sensors for altitude, acceleration, and temperature); **Structural Testing** (conducted drop tests and vibration analysis); **Launch Preparation** (integrated payloads with rocket airframes and recovery systems).

### Key Learning Outcomes
Amateur rocketry fundamentals and motor performance; sensor selection and calibration; G-force mitigation and structural design; field testing and rapid troubleshooting; data recovery and post-flight analysis.

### Impact
Working with amateur rocketry provided students a more accessible entry point to aerospace engineering. They could iterate quickly, test multiple designs, and see immediate results from their engineering decisions. The hands-on nature built confidence in fabrication skills and practical problem-solving.

## Northrop Grumman Payload Partnership

### Challenge
Collaborate with Northrop Grumman engineers to develop student payloads for high-altitude launches. This partnership required professional-level documentation, regular progress reviews with industry mentors, and integration with Northrop Grumman launch systems.

### Approach
Students followed aerospace industry standards throughout the project: **Requirements Review** (met with NG engineers to understand mission parameters); **Design Reviews** (presented preliminary and critical design reviews to industry panel); **Documentation** (created technical drawings, test plans, and safety analyses); **Integration Testing** (worked with NG team on payload-vehicle integration); **Mission Support** (participated in launch operations and telemetry monitoring).

### Key Learning Outcomes
Professional aerospace engineering practices; formal design review processes; technical documentation and presentation skills; collaboration with industry engineers; understanding of defense aerospace standards.

### Impact
This partnership exposed students to the rigor and professionalism of defense aerospace work. Many students who participated went on to pursue aerospace engineering degrees and several secured internships with Northrop Grumman or other aerospace companies. The experience showed students that they were capable of meeting industry standards when properly supported.
