## Overview

Project Zephyr is our student-led **high altitude weather balloon** mission. Students design the payload, integrate sensors and cameras, plan the flight, request FAA clearance, track telemetry, and perform a field recovery and post‑flight analysis.

## Highlights

- Target altitude: 80,000–100,000 ft (stratosphere)
- APRS/GPS live tracking with chase and recovery team
- Onboard sensors: temperature, pressure, humidity, IMU
- 4K action camera footage; thermal shielding and insulation
- Flight path prediction and weather window planning
- Post‑flight data analysis and presentation

## What Students Learn

- Systems engineering and test planning
- Electronics integration and power budgeting
- FAA coordination and safety/risk management
- Mapping, localization, and recovery logistics
- Technical communication and teamwork
