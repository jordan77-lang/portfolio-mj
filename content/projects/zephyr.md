## Overview

Project Zephyr is our student-led **high altitude weather balloon** mission. Students design the payload, integrate sensors and cameras, plan the flight, request FAA clearance, track telemetry, and perform a field recovery and post‑flight analysis.

## Highlights

Target altitude: 80,000–100,000 ft (stratosphere); APRS/GPS live tracking with chase and recovery team; onboard sensors (temperature, pressure, humidity, IMU); 4K action camera footage with thermal shielding and insulation; flight path prediction and weather window planning; post‑flight data analysis and presentation.

## What Students Learn

Systems engineering and test planning; electronics integration and power budgeting; FAA coordination and safety/risk management; mapping, localization, and recovery logistics; technical communication and teamwork.
