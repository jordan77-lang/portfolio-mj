## Overview

Project Zephyr is a student-led high-altitude weather balloon mission that brings aerospace engineering to life. Students design and build the payload, integrate sensors and cameras, plan the launch, request FAA clearance, track telemetry in real time, and conduct field recovery and post-flight analysis. The project merges scientific research, engineering design, and teamwork into a full-scale aerospace mission.

## Highlights

- Target altitude: 80,000–100,000 ft in the stratosphere
- APRS/GPS live tracking with chase and recovery operations
- Onboard sensors: temperature, pressure, humidity, and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
- 4K camera system with thermal insulation and environmental shielding
- Flight path prediction and weather window planning
- Comprehensive post-flight data analysis and presentation

## Learning Impact

Students apply systems engineering principles, electronics integration, and power budgeting while coordinating with the FAA for flight clearance and safety compliance. They gain hands-on experience in risk management, mapping, recovery logistics, and technical communication—skills that translate directly into aerospace, robotics, and data science pathways.
