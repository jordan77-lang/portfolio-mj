## Dreamscape Learn / Arizona State University

Role: Curriculum Designer

Summary:

Designed and implemented immersive, inquiry-driven university curricula that bridge virtual reality (VR) narratives with student-centered learning experiences through problem-based missions, authentic data analysis, and scientific reasoning. Courses span biology, chemistry, economics, sustainability, and astronomy, aligning with ASU's Charter and the Dreamscape Learn (DSL) pedagogical framework that merges scientific exploration with real-world decision-making.

All materials adhere to the DSL Style Guide, Writing and Copyedit Guidelines, and Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace for precision, inclusivity, and clarity.

Key Highlights / Responsibilities and Contributions:

**Leadership in Curriculum Development:**
- Took on leadership responsibilities in curriculum development, establishing production pipelines, file standards, and workflow consistency across interdisciplinary teams
- Developed documentation for writing, editing, and review cycles now used to streamline DSL curriculum production

**Accessibility and Inclusive Design:**
- Partnered with the instructional design team to create curriculum accessibility standards ensuring that all written, visual, and media materials are accessible to every learner
- Designed and launched a website powered by OpenAI's API that automatically generates image alt text, long descriptions, and figure interpretations for use in curriculum production
- Created a second API-based website to generate and align learning objectives and outcomes with curriculum activities and assessments, ensuring consistent scaffolding across courses and modules

**Technical and Software Expansion:**
- Expanded skill set to include Articulate Storyline, Airtable, Java, and Python, using these tools to enhance interactivity, curriculum tracking, and instructional design
- Built Airtable project management tools to map and track learning objectives, module outcomes, and linked assessment questions at the course, act, and objective level

**Visualization and Media Production:**
- Authored and produced Google Sheets tutorial videos that teach data analysis, function use, and trendline interpretation across the chemistry and biology curriculum
- Wrote and edited educational video scripts and training content for both student-facing and faculty-facing tutorials
- Created lab protocol illustrations and diagrams for CHM 113 to visualize experimental setups, materials, and data collection methods
- Designed 3D-modeled solar system and moon-phase scale models for the Astronomy curriculum to strengthen spatial reasoning and visual accessibility

## Curriculum Design and Development

### Biology (BIO 181 – General Biology I)

Theme: Systems thinking and data analysis through the Alien Zoo narrative

Key contributions:

- Converted all open-ended questions to closed-ended, rubric-based assessments for automated grading
- Adapted Module 0 to follow the Alien Zoo storyline featuring Skyrays, linking biological systems and ecological data interpretation
- Authored Google Sheets tutorials focusing on frequency, probability, and modeling applications
- Collaborated with biology subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure disciplinary accuracy and alignment with OpenStax Biology 2e
- Developed the high school adaptation of BIO 181 for Dreamscape Learn field experiences, creating inquiry-based activities for secondary learners

### Chemistry (CHM 113 – General Chemistry I)

Key contributions:

- Authored mission memos, lab protocols, and mission trainings across all acts (Atoms and Bonding, Aqueous Solutions, Filter Lab)
- Developed fully scaffolded three-objective mission structures linking narrative investigation to authentic lab data analysis
- Integrated Google Sheets data analysis and mathematical modeling for quantitative and graphical interpretation
- Created lab protocol illustrations to standardize visual lab instructions and support universal comprehension

### Economics (ECN 212 – Principles of Microeconomics)

Key contributions:

- Designed Formative 1: Market Behavior and Profit Strategy, an interactive narrative assignment exploring production, pricing, and efficiency
- Authored learning objectives on fixed, variable, total, average, and marginal costs, and the MR = MC profit-maximization principle
- Built Google Sheets cost and revenue models to visualize firm decision-making and performance
- Collaborated with economics SMEs to align assessment data and visual modeling with OpenStax Microeconomics 3e

### Global Futures (CGF 194 – Shaping Tomorrow, Today)

Key contributions:

- Co-developed a six-module interdisciplinary curriculum on planetary systems, sustainability, and regenerative futures
- Authored assignments and cognitive mapping activities across modules including Arctic Futures, Coral Reefs and the Blue Economy, Food Systems, and the Design Challenge: Envision, Create, and Evaluate Alternative Futures
- Integrated the Robustness–Failure–Regeneration timeline and Design Quadrant Framework to scaffold systems thinking and scenario planning
- Collaborated with sustainability SMEs to ensure ecological, ethical, and equity-driven learning design
