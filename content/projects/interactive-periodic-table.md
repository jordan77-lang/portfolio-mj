## Overview

This interactive periodic table provides an engaging way for students to explore the elements, their properties, and their organization within the periodic system. By hovering over any element, students can see enlarged details including atomic number, symbol, element name, and atomic mass. Color-coding by element families (alkali metals, noble gases, transition metals, etc.) helps visualize patterns and relationships.

---

## How to Use

### For Students
1. **Hover** over any element to see it enlarge with detailed information
2. **Observe colors** to identify element families and groups
3. **Notice patterns** in the arrangement (periods, groups, families)
4. Use as a **quick reference** during homework or lab work

### For Teachers
- Embed directly in Canvas, Google Classroom, or course websites
- Use on interactive whiteboards for whole-class instruction
- Assign as exploration activity before formal periodic table instruction
- Reference during chemistry labs and problem-solving sessions

## Educational Value

### Visual Learning
The color-coded families help students see patterns before they've memorized group names. Hover interactions make exploring element properties engaging rather than tedious.

### Accessibility
Works on any device with a web browser—no special software or downloads required. Students can access from school computers, tablets, or smartphones.

### Self-Directed Discovery
Students can explore at their own pace, returning to elements multiple times as they learn more advanced concepts. The table grows with their understanding.
