## Overview

Taking Flight at EVIT is a free community event that celebrates aviation, robotics, and hands-on STEM learning. Hosted at the East Valley Institute of Technology (EVIT), this event brings together students, families, educators, and industry partners for a day of flight demonstrations, competitions, workshops, and interactive learning experiences.

The event serves multiple purposes: introducing young students to aviation and aerospace concepts, providing a competitive venue for FTC robotics teams, and creating community connections between educational institutions, industry partners, and families interested in STEM education.

## Event Components

### RC Aircraft Demonstrations & Open Flying
Licensed pilots from the Academy of Model Aeronautics (AMA) demonstrate various types of radio-controlled aircraft, from sport planes to advanced aerobatic models. Registered AMA pilots can participate in open flying sessions and aerial combat competitions throughout the day.

### Foam Board Glider Workshop
Guided hands-on sessions where students ages 5-12 build and test foam board gliders under teacher supervision. Participants learn basic aerodynamics, structural design, and flight principles while constructing their own flying models. The workshop includes structured build sessions at scheduled times; parent participation encouraged; hot glue construction techniques; immediate flight testing opportunities.

### FTC Robotics "First Look" Scrimmage
FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) teams from across the region participate in pre-season scrimmages, allowing teams to test their robots in competition conditions before official matches begin. This provides valuable practice and identifies areas for improvement early in the season.

Participating teams have included Tie Dye Samurai (14835); Valley X (2844); Knights of the Lab Table (8081); Carbo-Knights (19728); Plus +3 Robotics (12841); and many other regional FTC teams.

### Industry & Education Partner Booths
Educational institutions and aerospace industry partners set up interactive booths featuring career pathway information; hands-on demonstrations; technology showcases; college and technical school programs; industry recruitment and outreach.

## Educational Impact

### Community Engagement
The event regularly attracts hundreds of students and families, creating accessible entry points to aviation and STEM fields. By offering free admission and activities, it removes barriers to participation and exposes diverse audiences to aerospace education.

### Pipeline Development
Taking Flight serves as a recruitment and awareness tool for CTE programs, aerospace education pathways, and STEM careers. Students who attend often pursue further education in engineering, aviation, or technical fields.

### Multi-Age Learning
The event's design accommodates learners from elementary age through high school and beyond, with age-appropriate activities ranging from simple glider construction to advanced robotics competition and piloting demonstrations.

### Teacher Professional Development
The event provides networking opportunities for educators, sharing best practices in aviation education, project-based learning, and hands-on STEM instruction. Flight instructors and robotics coaches connect with peers and learn new approaches to technical education.

## My Role

As an aerospace education instructor and event partner, I contribute to Taking Flight by leading foam board glider workshops for elementary students; mentoring FTC robotics teams participating in scrimmages; coordinating with educational institutions and industry partners; sharing project-based learning strategies with fellow educators; recruiting students for advanced aerospace programs.

The event aligns with my broader mission of making STEM education accessible, hands-on, and connected to real-world applications in aviation and aerospace engineering.

## Lessons Learned

### Accessibility Matters
Offering free admission and materials dramatically increases participation from diverse communities. Many families attending had never experienced aviation or robotics events before.

### Hands-On Wins
Students are far more engaged building and flying their own gliders than passively watching demonstrations. Active learning creates lasting impressions and interest in STEM fields.

### Competition Motivates
The FTC scrimmage component provides meaningful stakes for robotics teams while maintaining a supportive, pre-season atmosphere. Teams benefit from real match experience without the pressure of official competition.

### Community Partnerships Amplify Impact
No single organization could create an event of this scale. Collaboration between schools, industry, nonprofits, and hobbyist organizations multiplies resources and expertise.

### Multi-Generational Appeal
Events that include activities for young children, competitive opportunities for teens, and professional networking for adults create stronger community connections and support for STEM education programs.
