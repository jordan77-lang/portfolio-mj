## Overview

In 2013, I received the National Education Association (NEA) Excellence in Public School Education Full‑Tuition Scholarship, awarded through Walden University’s Richard W. Riley College of Education and Leadership. This competitive national award recognizes educators who make a measurable difference in advancing excellence in public education through leadership, innovation, and community engagement.

## Purpose of the Award

The NEA Excellence in Public School Education Scholarship provides full tuition for graduate study to NEA members who demonstrate a record of transformative leadership in their schools or districts. Recipients are selected based on their commitment to improving teaching and learning, contributions to the educational community, and vision for elevating public education.

## My Contributions

At the time of the award, I was teaching in Gilbert Public Schools at Mesquite High School, where I revitalized the Industrial Arts program—transforming it from near closure to exceeding enrollment capacity within two years. Previously, I strengthened the Theatre Department, growing it into an inclusive, collaborative program that fostered creativity across the student community.

Beyond the classroom, I served in leadership roles within the Gilbert Education Association (GEA):

- Vice President of High School Concerns
- Site Representative
- Member, School Improvement Committee
- Member, Interest‑Based Bargaining Team
- Designer of the GEA logo and creator of the Association’s website

These contributions reflect my belief that teachers lead not only through instruction but also through service, mentorship, and advocacy for the profession.

## Academic and Professional Impact

Through this scholarship, I pursued my Master of Science in Instructional Design & Technology (Emphasis in Online Learning) at Walden University, deepening my ability to design engaging, learner‑centered educational experiences grounded in research and innovation. This opportunity helped bridge classroom teaching with broader curriculum design and technology integration—skills I continue to apply to advance public education and teacher collaboration.

## Reflection

Receiving the NEA Excellence in Public School Education Scholarship affirmed my dedication to fostering meaningful learning experiences and contributing to the growth of public education. It remains a defining moment in my career—recognition of past accomplishments and a commitment to continuous improvement as an educator and curriculum designer.
