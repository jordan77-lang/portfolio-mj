## Overview

In collaboration with Blue Origin, students designed and built a scientific payload that flew aboard a suborbital rocket. This real-world aerospace project integrated engineering design, sensor technology, mission planning, and data analysis.

## Mission Objectives

- Design a compact, ruggedized payload to withstand launch and flight conditions
- Integrate sensors and data collection systems for mission-specific experiments
- Coordinate with aerospace industry professionals on flight requirements and safety protocols

## Student Experience

Students worked through the full engineering lifecycle—concept, design review, fabrication, testing, launch preparation, and post-flight data analysis—gaining insight into professional aerospace workflows.

## Outcomes

The payload successfully completed its mission, providing students with hands-on experience in space-adjacent engineering and inspiring future careers in aerospace and STEM fields.
