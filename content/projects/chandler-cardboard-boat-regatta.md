## Overview

The Chandler Cardboard Boat Regatta challenges students to apply engineering principles in a hands-on competition. Teams design, build, and race boats made entirely from cardboard and duct tape, testing buoyancy, structural integrity, and creative problem-solving under real-world constraints.

## Challenge

Students must create a watercraft capable of supporting crew members and completing a race courseâ€”all while using only cardboard, duct tape, and their ingenuity.

## Learning Outcomes

- Applied engineering design process (research, prototype, test, iterate)
- Hands-on experience with buoyancy, weight distribution, and structural design
- Teamwork, project management, and resourcefulness
- Real-world consequences of design decisions

## Impact

This annual event brings together students, families, and the community in a celebration of creativity and engineering, demonstrating that STEM learning can be engaging, competitive, and fun.
