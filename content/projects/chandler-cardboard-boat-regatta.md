**Event Organizer | Chandler Unified School District**

## Overview

Developed and led a district-wide engineering design challenge where students built and raced life-sized boats made entirely of cardboard and adhesive materials. Teams applied physics and engineering principles to design buoyant, stable watercraft capable of carrying two paddlers across a full pool course.

## Highlights

Organized and directed competition for all high school engineering departments in Chandler; managed safety inspections, race heats, and event logistics at the Hamilton Aquatic Center; designed engineering challenge rules, construction guidelines, and instructional materials; engaged more than 100 students in hands-on learning about buoyancy, structure, and teamwork; partnered with educators and community facilities to ensure safety, inclusion, and engagement.

## Learning Impact

Students experienced the complete engineering design process—from initial concept to prototype testing and redesign. The event fostered creativity, collaboration, and real-world problem solving, transforming STEM principles into a dynamic, high-energy community experience.
