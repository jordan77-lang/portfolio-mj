I worked on HGTV's Over Your Head as the master carpenter and on‑camera host, helping homeowners rescue challenging renovations under real deadlines and constraints.

*On set during an Over Your Head renovation — rapid design/build with homeowners on camera*

Highlights:
- Three seasons of nationally broadcast episodes
- Led construction, finish carpentry, and rapid design/build on location
- Mentored homeowners while ensuring quality, safety, and durability
- Projects ranged from kitchens and bathrooms to patios and complete backyard transformations
