I worked on HGTV's Over Your Head as the master carpenter and on‑camera host, helping homeowners rescue challenging renovations under real deadlines and constraints.

**Highlights:** Three seasons of nationally broadcast episodes; led construction, finish carpentry, and rapid design/build on location; mentored homeowners while ensuring quality, safety, and durability; projects ranged from kitchens and bathrooms to patios and complete backyard transformations.
