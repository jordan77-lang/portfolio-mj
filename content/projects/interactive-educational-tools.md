## Overview

I design both digital and physical learning tools that make complex STEM concepts easier to see and understand. Digital tools run in any modern browser and embed cleanly in Canvas or Google Classroom. Physical models are 3D-designed manipulatives for hands-on classroom exploration.

What these tools emphasize:
- Accessibility: works on common classroom devices
- Interactivity: learn by exploring, not just reading
- Visual learning: intuitive models and animations
- Easy integration: simple links or embeds in LMS

## Digital Educational Tools

### [Learning Objective Generator](/projects/learning-objective-generator/)
AI-powered tool that reverse‑engineers measurable, standards‑aligned learning objectives from course materials (outlines, assignments, lesson text).

Key features:
- Applies Bloom's Taxonomy, ABCD Model, SMART Criteria, and Constructive Alignment
- OpenAI‑assisted text analysis for automated objective generation
- JSON-structured outputs for export and downstream use
- Aligns to NGSS and CCSS standards

### [Educational Image Accessibility Tool](/projects/educational-image-accessibility-tool/)
Generate high‑quality alt text, figure descriptions, long descriptions, and transcriptions for curriculum images. Built around WCAG guidelines and educational standards.

---

### [Interactive Periodic Table](/projects/interactive-periodic-table/)
Explore element properties, atomic structure, and chemical families through simple visual interaction.

Key features:
- Detail-on-hover for element information
- Family color-coding
- Works well on tablets and classroom displays

## 3D Physical Manipulatives

These are physical models designed in Fusion 360 for hands-on classroom exploration.

### [Scale Solar System Models](/projects/solar-system-models/)
3D-modeled manipulatives that demonstrate realistic distance and size relationships in the solar system.

Design features:
- Two versions: distance scale and size scale
- Designed in Fusion 360 for 3D printing
- Accurate proportions for classroom demonstrations


---

### [Moon Phase Model](/projects/moon-phase-model/)
Physical 3D model designed to demonstrate Earth–Moon–Sun geometry and lunar phases.

Design features:
- 3D-modeled in Fusion 360
- Shows phase relationships through physical manipulation
- Demonstrates why we see different moon phases
---

### [Articulate Rise Course Modules](/projects/articulate-rise-modules/)
Professional eLearning modules with responsive design, interactive checks, and LMS integration.

Key features:
- Mobile-responsive design
- Knowledge checks and quizzes
- SCORM/xAPI LMS integration
