## Overview

I build interactive tools that make complex STEM concepts easier to see and understand. They run in any modern browser and embed cleanly in Canvas or Google Classroom. The focus is on clarity, interactivity, and accessibility.

What these tools emphasize:
- Accessibility: works on common classroom devices
- Interactivity: learn by exploring, not just reading
- Visual learning: intuitive models and animations
- Easy integration: simple links or embeds in LMS
