## Overview

I design both digital and physical learning tools that make complex STEM concepts easier to see and understand. Digital tools run in any modern browser and embed cleanly in Canvas or Google Classroom. Physical models are 3D-designed manipulatives for hands-on classroom exploration.

What these tools emphasize:
- Accessibility: works on common classroom devices
- Interactivity: learn by exploring, not just reading
- Visual learning: intuitive models and animations
- Easy integration: simple links or embeds in LMS

## Digital Educational Tools

### Learning Objective Generator (AI-Powered Instructional Design Tool)
This tool uses AI to reverse‑engineer measurable, standards‑aligned learning objectives from course materials (outlines, assignments, lesson text). It applies Bloom’s Taxonomy, ABCD, SMART, and Constructive Alignment principles, with exportable JSON for downstream use.

Frameworks:
- Bloom’s Taxonomy • ABCD Model • SMART Criteria • Constructive Alignment • NGSS/CCSS

Technology:
- OpenAI‑assisted text analysis • JSON outputs • Web front‑end hosted on Netlify

### [Educational Image Accessibility Tool](/projects/educational-image-accessibility-tool/)
Generate high‑quality alt text, figure descriptions, long descriptions, and transcriptions for curriculum images. Built around WCAG guidelines and educational standards.

---

### [Interactive Periodic Table](/projects/interactive-periodic-table/)
Explore element properties, atomic structure, and chemical families through simple visual interaction.

Key features:
- Detail-on-hover for element information
- Family color-coding
- Works well on tablets and classroom displays

Use cases:
- Unit intro, lab reference, and periodic trends

## 3D Physical Manipulatives

These are physical models designed in Fusion 360 for hands-on classroom exploration.

### [Scale Solar System Models](/projects/solar-system-models/)
3D-modeled manipulatives that demonstrate realistic distance and size relationships in the solar system.

Design features:
- Two versions: distance scale and size scale
- Designed in Fusion 360 for 3D printing
- Accurate proportions for classroom demonstrations

Use cases:
- Astronomy introductions and scale/proportion concepts
- Hands-on exploration of planetary distances and sizes

---

### [Moon Phase Model](/projects/moon-phase-model/)
Physical 3D model designed to demonstrate Earth–Moon–Sun geometry and lunar phases.

Design features:
- 3D-modeled in Fusion 360
- Shows phase relationships through physical manipulation
- Demonstrates why we see different moon phases

Use cases:
- Lunar cycles, Earth–Moon–Sun relationships, and calendars
- Hands-on demonstration of lunar mechanics

---

### [Articulate Rise Course Modules](/projects/articulate-rise-modules/)
Professional eLearning modules with responsive design, interactive checks, and LMS integration.

Key features:
- Mobile-responsive design
- Knowledge checks and quizzes
- SCORM/xAPI LMS integration
