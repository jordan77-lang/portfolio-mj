## Overview

Articulate Rise has become my go-to tool for creating professional, mobile-responsive eLearning modules that work seamlessly across all devices and integrate perfectly with Canvas LMS and other learning management systems. These courses combine instructional design best practices with engaging multimedia and interactive assessments to create comprehensive learning experiences.

Unlike static PDFs or video-only content, Rise modules provide a structured learning path with built-in interactivity, progress tracking, and assessment tools that help students stay engaged and demonstrate mastery.

## Course Development Process

### 1. Learning Objectives
Start with clear, measurable learning objectives that define what students should know or be able to do after completing the module.

### 2. Storyboard & Script
Outline content structure, write concise explanatory text, and plan where interactive elements will enhance understanding.

### 3. Multimedia Creation
Record video demonstrations, create graphics, source or record audio narration, and gather supporting resources.

### 4. Rise Development
Build the course in Rise, adding text blocks, multimedia, interactive knowledge checks, and navigation structure.

### 5. Review & Iterate
Test on multiple devices, have colleagues review for clarity and accuracy, revise based on feedback.

### 6. LMS Integration
Export as SCORM package, upload to Canvas or target LMS, configure settings, and test completion tracking.

### 7. Student Testing & Refinement
Monitor first cohort's progress, identify confusing sections, revise based on student questions and performance data.

## Educational Impact

### Self-Paced Flexibility
Students can progress through material at their own speed, rewatching videos, retaking quizzes, and revisiting content as needed for mastery.

### Accessibility
Rise's built-in accessibility features ensure courses work with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Closed captions on videos support deaf/hard-of-hearing students and English language learners.

### Data-Driven Instruction
LMS integration provides instructors with data on:
- Which students are falling behind
- What sections students struggle with most
- How long students spend on each lesson
- Quiz performance by learning objective

This data helps instructors provide targeted support and improve course design iteratively.

### Flipped Classroom Support
Rise modules work perfectly for flipped instruction, allowing students to consume foundational content at home so class time can focus on application, discussion, and hands-on activities.

## Best Practices Learned

### Keep It Focused
Each module should address 2-4 related learning objectives. Longer content should be broken into multiple shorter modules.

### Chunk Content
Break text into digestible sections with frequent headings, images, and interactive elements. No screen should contain more than 3-4 paragraphs.

### Test Early & Often
View courses on actual smartphones and tablets, not just browser emulation. Real device testing reveals navigation and readability issues.

### Use Multimedia Strategically
Don't add video just because you can. Use multimedia when it genuinely enhances understanding (demonstrating a process, showing real-world examples, adding emotional impact).

### Assess Authentically
Knowledge checks should mirror how students will actually apply the learning. Scenario-based questions outperform simple recall.
