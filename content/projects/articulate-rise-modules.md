## Overview

Articulate Rise has become my go-to tool for creating professional, mobile-responsive eLearning modules that work seamlessly across all devices and integrate perfectly with Canvas LMS and other learning management systems. These courses combine instructional design best practices with engaging multimedia and interactive assessments to create comprehensive learning experiences.

Unlike static PDFs or video-only content, Rise modules provide a structured learning path with built-in interactivity, progress tracking, and assessment tools that help students stay engaged and demonstrate mastery.
