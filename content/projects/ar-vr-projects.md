### Gaussian Splat WebXR Meta App (In Progress)

Exploring Gaussian Splatting to create interactive WebXR environments. The goal is a ‚Äúmeta app‚Äù that lets you invite avatars into your home and visit together in VR from anywhere in the world.

Current workflow:
- Capture images and video of a space
- Generate COLMAP point clouds for camera poses and sparse/dense reconstruction
- Train and export a Gaussian Splat of the environment
- Integrate the splat into a WebXR scene for immersive exploration and social presence

Status and next steps:
- Initial COLMAP reconstructions complete; early Gaussian splat tests underway
- Next: WebXR integration, multi-user avatars, occlusion, and mobile performance tuning
