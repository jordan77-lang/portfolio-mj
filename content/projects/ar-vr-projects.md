## Overview

As part of my exploration into immersive learning technologies, I've developed several AR and VR projects that demonstrate the potential of extended reality (XR) for education and engagement. These projects combine 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and interactive experiences.

## Featured Projects

### Gaussian Splat WebXR Meta App (In Progress)

Exploring Gaussian Splatting to create interactive WebXR environments. The goal is a “meta app” that lets you invite avatars into your home and visit together in VR from anywhere in the world.

Current workflow:
- Capture images and video of a space
- Generate COLMAP point clouds for camera poses and sparse/dense reconstruction
- Train and export a Gaussian Splat of the environment
- Integrate the splat into a WebXR scene for immersive exploration and social presence

Status and next steps:
- Initial COLMAP reconstructions complete; early Gaussian splat tests underway
- Next: WebXR integration, multi-user avatars, occlusion, and mobile performance tuning

COLMAP point cloud test:
