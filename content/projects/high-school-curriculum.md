	- Introduction to Engineering and Design — engineering design process, 3D modeling, and prototyping
	- Principles of Engineering — mechanisms, structures, materials, and automation
	- Digital Electronics — circuit design, logic systems, and simulation
	- Aerospace Engineering — flight physics, propulsion, and robotics integration
	- Engineering Design and Development — senior capstone with community mentorship
- Customized PLTW instructional materials to integrate district learning outcomes, assessment criteria, and Arizona CTE standards
- Integrated CAD and 3D printing into project phases to enhance design iteration and prototype testing
