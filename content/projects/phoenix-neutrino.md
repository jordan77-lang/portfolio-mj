## Overview

As director of the **Phoenix Neutrino Project**, I brought this groundbreaking theatre format to Arizona, uniting 40+ improv performers from across the Valley to create completely unscripted films—live, in front of an audience, in under 20 minutes.

This wasn't traditional improv or conventional filmmaking. It was both, simultaneously—a footrace, improv show, and guerrilla film production all rolled into one explosive performance format.

## What Made It Unique

**The Challenge:**  
14 performers split into three teams. Audience members throw random props on stage. Teams disperse into Phoenix with handheld cameras to film 2.5-minute scenes at live locations—restaurants, parking lots, businesses—while a "runner" physically sprints tapes back to the theatre. Editors live-mix the footage with music and credits. Total time: 20 minutes. No script. No rehearsal. No second takes.

**The Format:**
- Performers included actors, directors/camera operators, and runners
- Props came from audience members (anything from breath mints to jewelry)
- Locations scouted same-day across Phoenix
- Live soundtrack mixed on the fly using mood notes
- Actors used hand signals ("power fist" for danger, police, angry civilians)
- Films screened immediately for the audience

## My Role as Director

- Brought the Neutrino format to Arizona from Chicago (franchise licensed from the New York originators)
- Organized monthly shows at The Paper Heart Gallery in Phoenix
- Coordinated 40+ performers from 15+ Valley improv troupes (Apollo 12, Galapagos, The Remainders, Light Rail Pirates, Mail-Order Bride, The Originals, and more)
- Managed production logistics, camera equipment, and live editing workflow
- Built a supportive improv community—"Neutrino Nation"—that unified performers across Phoenix

## The Magic & The Madness

**"It's almost unbelievable when we look at what we do. Like, how do we do it in time? It's just magic, there's no other explanation."** — Mark Jordan

The show ran so smoothly that audiences watching on chairs and couches at The Paper Heart felt like they were watching a polished independent film—unaware that runners were silently sprinting miles behind them, or that actors were staying in character while being confronted by police or angry business owners.

### Memorable Moments

- **The Starbucks Scene:** Actor Jose Gonzalez ranted against corporate America and diamond mines while his character fought for his girlfriend at Starbucks. A real cop appeared mid-scene ready to arrest another actor wielding a parking cone—until he realized they were filming and broke into laughter.
- **The Holsum Bakery Incident:** A team infiltrated a bread factory to win a $20 bounty, filming among conveyor belts of bread à la *Laverne & Shirley*—until security chased them out.
- **Real-World Interruptions:** Actors frequently had to improvise around police, confused bystanders, and business owners while staying in character. One performer had to explain his love for a scene partner to an angry property owner—without breaking character.

## Why It Mattered

Neutrino wasn't about money. It was about pushing creative boundaries and sharing the impossible with an audience. The format required performers to stay grounded in reality (no 20-foot giants like stage improv), maintain characters under real-world pressure, and work with comedians they'd never collaborated with before.

**"When it's over, you feel like you've been hit by a truck because it's so much work. And no one's in it to make money. The Neutrino Project's about doing the project and sharing it with the public."** — Mark Jordan
