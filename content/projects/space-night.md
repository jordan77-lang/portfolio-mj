## Overview

Space Night was a one-night community event celebrating space exploration and STEM. For a single evening, the campus transformed into an interactive space science museum designed and run by students. The event invited families, educators, and local organizations to experience hands-on learning through exploration, creativity, and collaboration.

## Highlights

Attracted more than 500 attendees from across the community; featured student-built exhibits and demonstrations, including rockets, rovers, robotics, and 3D printing; included telescope viewing (weather permitting) with local astronomy partners and guest speakers from NASA programs, universities, and industry; inspired Kâ€“12 students to explore STEM pathways and strengthened community engagement in science and engineering.

## Role and Contributions

I conceived, organized, and directed Space Night from concept to completion. Responsibilities included event planning, sponsor outreach, budgeting, logistics coordination, and student training. I collaborated with faculty, local businesses, and STEM organizations to secure exhibits and guest experts. I also developed promotional materials, designed interactive learning stations, and managed more than 60 student volunteers to deliver a full-scale public STEM experience.
