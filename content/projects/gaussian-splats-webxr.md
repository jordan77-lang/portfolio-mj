## Overview

I'm prototyping a meta-like app that lets you invite avatars into your own space to visit together in VR, across the world. The pipeline starts with real-world image/video capture, reconstructs the scene with COLMAP, then generates a Gaussian Splat representation for real-time, photorealistic rendering on the web.

## Workflow

1. Capture photos and video of the environment
2. Reconstruct camera poses + point clouds in COLMAP (sparse â†’ dense)
3. Train and export a Gaussian Splat of the environment
4. Load the splat in a WebXR scene for immersive navigation
5. Add multi-user avatars, interaction, and occlusion

## Demo Clips

## Technology

- COLMAP for structure-from-motion and dense reconstruction
- Gaussian Splatting for efficient, photorealistic scene rendering
- WebXR for browser-based AR/VR
- Potential viewers/tooling: Three.js + WebXR, gsplat-based viewers, or custom GLSL pipelines

## Status & Next Steps

- âœ… COLMAP reconstructions (initial tests)
- âœ… Early Gaussian splat experiments
- ðŸ”œ WebXR scene integration (navigation, controller mapping)
- ðŸ”œ Multi-user avatars (WebRTC or websocket relay)
- ðŸ”œ Occlusion and collision for presence realism
- ðŸ”œ Mobile performance tuning and progressive loading

## Vision

A sharable link where friends can join you inside your own captured environment, explore together, and interactâ€”straight from a browser-enabled VR headset or desktop, no app install required.
